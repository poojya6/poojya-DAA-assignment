31.You are climbing a staircase. It takes nsteps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
(i)Input: n=4
Output: 5

def countWays(n):
    if n==0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    dp=[0]*(n + 1)
    dp[0]=1
    dp[1]=1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i]=dp[i-1]+dp[i-2]
    return dp[n]
n = 4
print(countWays(n))

Output: 5
