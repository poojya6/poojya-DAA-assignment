30.You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security systems connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
(i)Input : nums = [2, 3, 2]
Output : The maximum money you can rob without alerting the 
police is 3(robbing house 1).

def rob_linear(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    n==len(nums)
    if n==1:
        return nums[0]
    if n==2:
        return max(nums[0],nums[1])
    
    dp=[0]*n
    dp[0]=nums[0]
    dp[1]=max(nums[0],nums[1])
    
    for i in range(2,n):
        dp[i]=max(dp[i-1],dp[i-2]+nums[i])
    return dp[-1]
def rob(nums):
    if len(nums)==1:
        return nums[0]
    max1 = rob_linear(nums[:-1])
    max2 = rob_linear(nums[1:])
    return max(max1, max2)
nums = [2, 3, 2]
print(rob(nums))

Output: 3
